# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing
A simple but effective solution to the Mercedes Benz kaggle competition . This solution shows the importance of EDA and Feature Engineering.

The Goal of this case study is to reduce the time it takes for each car to undergo testing before it leaves the factory and at the same time the quality shouldn't be compramised.

The error metric of choice here is R^2 -->(Real-Predicted)^2.

The challenge here is that the second dimension of the data is quite large with reference to the first dimenssion (number of columns are high), this leads to curse of dimenssionality.

We will do EDA inorder to eliminate least useful features.
